# Instructor Guide — Week 2: Basics Mastery

## Purpose & Focus
Translate theory to consistent hands: line + precision integration.

## Required Equipment & Setup
- Chair(s), mannequins with stands
- Clippers (rotary + magnetic), trimmers (T & square), shavettes + blades
- Shears (bevel + convex), comb set, guards (#0.5–#4 minimum)
- Spray bottles, towels, capes, neck strips, gloves
- Disinfectants (quats/alcohol per Appendix B), tool mat, sharps container
- Cross-lighting: two light sources, ~4000–5000K, CRI ≥ 90
- Mirror and secondary hand mirror

## Demonstrations (Step-by-Step)
- Demo 1: Guard/lever theory on whiteboard.
- Demo 2: Fade baseline + Lever Ladder erase.
- Demo 3: Curved neckline with symmetry map.

## Timing & Pacing (90–120 min suggested)
- 10 min recap, 20 min demos, 60 min practice, 20 min critique.

## Checkpoints & Live Assessment
- Sanitation & setup meets Appendix B checklist
- Tool handling: grip, angle control, lever discipline
- Symmetry mapping: four-point check (Appendix F)
- Fade banding: smooth gradients, no shadows
- Line sharpness: trimmer corners + razor finish at ~30°
- Professional conduct: consultation language, client comfort

## Differentiation Strategies (Mixed Skill Levels)
- Beginners: fixed-length taper drill; Advanced: timed low fade + line-up.

## Common Issues & Fixes
- Lines “wiggle”: stabilize wrist, reduce elbow height, re-check light direction
- Stuck demarcation: go one half-guard longer, then erase with corners
- Irritation with razor: reduce angle, use fresh blade, stretch skin
- Patchy blend on dense/Type 4 hair: fade blade, smaller strokes, cross-check
- Time overruns: pre-plan guard/lever sequence; set interim timers

## Assignments to Collect
- Sketches, practice videos, sanitation checklists, reflection journals

## Evidence of Mastery
- Rubric scores ≥ 4/5 across technical + sanitation + client experience
